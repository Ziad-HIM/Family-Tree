# Family-Tree
What An Amazing Looking Family
Aren't you tired of seeing family trees always in 2D? They often don’t show the features of the tree or the family members clearly. I used an oval base for the head and various shapes, along with some cutting, to create the glasses, eyes, and mouth. For the children’s hair, I duplicated multiple shapes to match their hairstyles. For the boys, I used a half-circle and an oval shape from behind to create a cap effect.
